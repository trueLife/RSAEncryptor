RSAEncryptor
============

RSAEncryptor
 // for big number handling support BigInteger class  is used
In this program we are using the rsa algorithm for encoding numbers in desired bit depth. p and q valus must be prime among them.and e is also must be prime number.
selecting e as a big value will cause better encryption.
